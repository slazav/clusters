We are using CORINE European Land Cover data [1,2]
to find all connected clusters of some terrain types, calculate
some parameters of each cluster (at least area and radii of
inscribed and escribed circles) and build distributions for
these parameters.

The final result would be such distributions for each type
of terrain, each country (if we have data for borders), each year.
(With some interface for selecting and comparing data.)

From this data one can see how area of e.g. forest
clusters changes with time or compare different counrtries.
It is also interesting to discuss are there any universal shape
for these kind of distributions.
