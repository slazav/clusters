We are using CORINE European Land Cover data [1,2]
to find all connected clusters of some terrain types, calculate
some parameters of each cluster (at least area and radii of
inscribed and escribed circles) and build distributions for
these parameters. Country borders can be found in [3].

The final result would be such distributions for each type of terrain,
each country, each year with some interface for selecting and comparing
data. (About 39 european countries, years 1990,2000,2006,2012 are available).

From this data one can see how area of e.g. forest
clusters changes with time or compare different counrtries.
It is also interesting to discuss are there any universal shape
for these kind of distributions.
